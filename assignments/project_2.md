# Week 2 Project: Build a Responsive Blog with Bootstrap

**Due:** Tuesday, May 1st at 10pm

## Overview
Your assignment for this week will be building a **responsive personal Blog**. You will only need to use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to build.

To start laying out your content, you can take a look at the responsive Blog template built by Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/blog/. 

Go to the website, and right-click on the page to 'View Page Source'. Then, have a look through at all the html elements inside the `<body>` with their bootstrap classes. Also, check out the external references such as stylesheets and Google fonts in `<head>`; and scripts near the end of `<body>` to understand more about the page.

## User Stories
The following user stories **must** be completed:
* [ ] Responsive for any screen (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone) with Bootstrap
* [ ] Have at least 2 pages:
    * 1 main overview page (index.html) like the Bootstrap [blog example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/blog/)
    * 1 blog page with at least a picture. If you don't have any picture, you can use https://placeholder.com/ for img and https://www.lipsum.com/ for dummy text
* [ ] Use [HTML5 sematic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) for page layout (less divs!)
* [ ] Use Bootstrap [grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) (container > row > col) to layout and align content.
* [ ] At least 2 [cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/) for featured posts
* [ ] [Navigation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) on header and social icons on footer (use https://fontawesome.com/icons for icons)
* [ ] Site navigation `<aside>` that includes an Archives list

## Tips
* Your blog should be **tailored** and **personal** to you. You don't have to follow exactly the Bootstrap blog as long as you complete all the *required* user stories.
* List out all the additional things that you have added to your personal blog

## Advanced
The following advanced user stories are **optional**. You are not required to do these, but you will learn more from doing them: 
* [ ] Use [button group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/button-group/) or [pagination](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/pagination/) to navigate between pages.
* [ ] Add a [modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/modal/) component (e.g. when clicing on 'Sign up' or 'Search' button)
* [ ] Include a 'Get in touch' [form](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/forms/) for guests to submit enquiries
* [ ] Add a [dropdown](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/) on top navigation

Submitted through GitHub:
  * Be sure to **include a README** containing a GIF walkthrough of your app.
