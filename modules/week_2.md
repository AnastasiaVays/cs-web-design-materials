# Week 2 Resources - Responsive, responsive, responsive!
Last week we learned about HTML and CSS, the two core technologies that make up websites. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure of the webpage, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the visual and layout of the webpage. 

We learned what make up an HTML element: start tag, content, and end tag. We know the difference between normal elements vs. empty elements (self-closing element), or the difference between inline vs. block elements. 

We learned about CSS selectors and CSS properties, how we can use `class` to apply styling to a group of elements, or how we can use `id` to apply styling to a unique element. We also learned about [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) (content, margin, border, and padding) and [CSS Positioning](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/) (static, relative, absolute, fixed, etc.) concepts that help you to understand how HTML elements are arranged and placed in a *viewport* of a web browser.

This week, we will learn how we can design websites that make them responsive. **Responsive web design** is an approach suggests that any design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior based on screen size, platform and orientation. Websites with responsive design look good on any devices (phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops). We will again be using only HTML and CSS to design responsive websites. 

The things will be going over today in class:
* Mobile first
* @media queries with breakpoints
* Coding practice
* Bootrap framework 
    - Why using Bootstrap? 
    - Bootstrap Grid system (container, row, column)
    - Bootstrap components

There is a new layout system called CSS Grid that is powerful and claim to be the future of webpage layout. Unlike Bootstrap, CSS Grid is neither framework or library. It is *native* to all new web browsers. Currently, not all the browers support CSS Grid as much as Bootstrap. There is an introduction to CSS Grid at the Learning Resources for whoever interested.
