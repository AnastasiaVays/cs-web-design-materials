# Week 3 Resources -  Design Thinking with the Wallet Project

Up to this point, you should have had a good grasp on how responsive websites are built from scratch, and a clear understanding of how the web works fundamentally. However, knowing all the tecnical requirements for building a site is not enough, you will also need to know how to create the **best experience** for your visitors.

This week, we will take a deep dive into the UI/UX aspects of building a website. UI and UX are the two crucial elements that make up a great product, and they work closely together.

UI (User Interface) is the interaction between the user and the interface of your product. UI Design relates to everything you see, touch, and hear within a website (or a piece of software). 

UX (User Experience) is the experience that a user has when they interact with every aspect of a product. UX Design relates to the usability, accessibility, and satisfaction provided in the interaction with the product.

In our lecture today, we will work on a popular challenge called "The Wallet Project". It is a design thinking project from [Stanford d.school](https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/the_wallet_project.html) in which participants pair up, learn about each othersâ€™ wallets, brainstorm, and prototype **ONE** new *useful and meaningful* wallet for both. 

## What is the Wallet Project?

It is a group activity in which students rapidly do a "full design cycle process." The project is broken down into specific steps, and student have worksheet packets that guide them. In addition one or two facilitators (not participating in the project) prompt each step, and add some verbal color and instruction.

## What will students learn?

Participants get the feel of a design approach, gain some shared vocabulary, and get a taste of each design "mode" (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test). Specifically, we hope students see the value of engaging with real people to help them ground their design decisions, that low-resolutions prototypes are useful to learn from (take an iterative approach), and to bias toward action (you can make a lot of progress in a little bit of time if you **start doing**).
