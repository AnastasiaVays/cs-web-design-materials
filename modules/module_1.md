# Week 1 Resources - The *essence* of the web!
Welcome to CoderSchool's Web Design Bootcamp Course. We're excited to embark you on a new journey 
in learning web development altogether!

If you are here it's mean that either you are curious about the whole technology and the world wide web, or you want to learn a new skillset for your career development, or you want to work and think like an enigneer. Either way, we are glad that you are here with us now to take on this course together.

In the first week, you will learn the most common HTML elements and CSS attributes that make up a webpage. We will also go over the **CSS Box Model** and **CSS Positioning**. These two concepts are the most important that will literally help you laying out any design on the web.

# Lab
In week 1 lab, you will be able to build Spotify [landing page](https://www.spotify.com/vn-en/) from scratch.

# Assignment
In your week 1 assignment, you will be able to build Grab [landing page](https://www.grab.com/vn/en/) from scratch.

Hopefully as part of the Prework you've set up your environment correctly. That includes NodeJS and an IDE (we recommend Visual Studio Code).

In the first week we will create our first apps on the blockchain. Get ready! Lots of these concepts are difficult and complicated but we'll just start by writing code. Don't worry if you don't understand absolutely everything - but feel free to ask questions!


**Due:** Monday, April 23th at 10pm

**Overview:** Build Grab [landing page](https://www.grab.com/vn/en/) from scratch using only HTML and CSS. The landing page does not have to be responsive because we will cover Responsive Web Design in week 2. This landing page is similar to the Spotify landing page that you did in Lab 1.

## User Stories
The following user stories **must** be completed:
* [ ] Top navigation bar with dropdown buttons
* [ ] Banner with background image, white text, and a green button
* [ ] Color or text change when mouse hovers over
* [ ] At least 3 different body sections with different background images or colors
* [ ] 2 (or 3) card items per row in a body section
* [ ] Footer with social icons that link to the actual social pages

## Tips
* The landing page does not have to be exactly the same as the original landing page as long as it can satisfy the above user stories. You can be creative and make it better than the original! 
* Do list out all the additional things that you have added to your landing page

## Advanced
The following advanced user stories are **optional**. You are not required to do these, but you will learn more from doing them: 
* [ ] Add favicon to the page
* [ ] Bootstrap carousel for banner
* [ ] Banner with background video
* [ ] Animation on an element
* [ ] Navigation, contact, sitemap, privacy policy, term of use, etc in footer

## Other Resources
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html) - the most popular web browser
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - a powerful text editor with a lot of useful plugins
