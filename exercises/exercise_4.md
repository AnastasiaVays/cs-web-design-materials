# Week 3 Lab: Build a landing page using Weebly

## Overview:
In this lab, you will again pair program with another person to create a landing page about your wallet. You’ll be using Weebly. The goal of this lab is to understand a web page’s layout, all of its elements, and each elements’ purpose. You’ll also concentrate on using the landing page to create a strong Call to Action.

## What is a Landing Page?
In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for the purposes of a marketing or advertising campaign. It's where a visitor “lands” when they have clicked on a Google AdWords ad or similar. Landing pages are designed with a single focused objective – known as a Call to Action (CTA).

For this landing page, I have one goal: I want people to click on the button to buy or use my product. That’s the Call to Action!
All successful landing pages have these elements: header, body, and footer. Let’s discuss them.

OK! Let’s go step by step.

## Milestone 1: PLANNING
(consinder using IDEO's design thinking or human0centered design)
* Talk to the client, or in this case, talk to your partner, try to empathize. Find out what the goal of the product is. What problem are you trying to solve for your customer? You already did a lot of this yesterday.
* Make a list of elements and their purpose. You can use pencil and paper to sketch out your designs and element placings. This can help you to use the landing page space effectively.
* After you sketch, open your design software, or in this case, use your Weebly tool. Let’s create content and add text to your design!

## Milestone 2: CONTENT and ELEMENTS
Next, we have to present the content in a much more organized, manageable way. To do this, we have to use a grid system. it is basically a system of horizontal and vertical lines, used to arrange the content.
### Header:
1. The Navigation Bar. Can have a logo on it or other destinations depending on your purpose. 
2. The Headline. A catchy, sexy title that tells your audience what the landing page is about. You can add more details with a subtitle.
3. The Call to Action! A button or something you want users to click or act on. For example, e-commerce sites will have a call to action button that says, “BUY NOW”
4. A Hero Image. A unique sort of illustration or graphic that’s relevant to the product.
### Body:
Elements, and content to introduce features of your product that you want to promote.
### Footer: 
Social media and channel icons. Like, facebook, instagram, email bla bla bla. Anything that you think that is not important enough to put on body of page. or even links of some other webpages.

## Milestone 3: STYLE
* If you have no idea about your own style or how to express a certain style you should search for inspiration. Search for designs that you really like from other websites. Pay attention to the style of the elements. The fonts used, the letter spacings, the color. You can remix them and put things together.
* Let's use weebly to pick a template. Be creative and think outside of the box!
* TIP: What is your product’s color? Pick that color and use my favourite tool: http://www.colorhexa.com to get a useful color pallette to combine the main color and the second color for your landing page. Use the background color that help your product shining (in simple way)
* You don’t like default icons or wanna do some extra for your landing page? Go to http://www.flaticon.com, search for icons or even packages of icons (that help your elements look consistent), save by .png to use.

## (BONUS) Milestone 4: PICTURE
* You can edit your products’ picture using this: https://www.picmonkey.com/photo-editor/photo-filters
